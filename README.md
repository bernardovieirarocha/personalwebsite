# Bernardo Rocha's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, bernardorocha.com. It's designed to showcase my skills, experience, and interests.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

* `public`: Static assets like images, fonts, and CSS files.
* `src`: Source code for the website, including components, pages, and styles.
* `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts.

## Development

Feel free to fork the repo and modify the code in the `src` directory to customize the website to your liking.

## Deployment

To deploy the website to a production server, you'll need to follow the specific instructions for your hosting provider. This might involve building the project for production and transferring the generated files to your server.

## Inspiration

This website is inspired by the work of [Jarocki](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki) and TailWindCSS Spotlight Theme.
